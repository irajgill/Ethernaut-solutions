Using the Chrome developer tools you can see the level address that will be used to create a challenge contract instance for you. You can call contract.abi in the console to see the available functions to call on the contract. After calling the various info functions you receive a hint that you need to call the authenticate function with a password to pass this level. The password can be retrieved by the password() function and is ethernaut0.
